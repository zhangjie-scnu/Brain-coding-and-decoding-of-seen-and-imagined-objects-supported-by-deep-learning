# Brain-coding-and-decoding-of-seen-and-imagined-objects-supported-by-deep-learning
Object recognition is a key function of human vision and machine vision. Based on the interpretability theory of deep learning, we propose a decoding method for concrete objects. Visual features, including those from deep neural networks, can be predicted from fMRI patterns, and for low/high level features with low/high level visual regions, higher precision is achieved, respectively. Predictive features are used to identify visible/simulated object classes from features in a set of computed multiple object images (extended beyond decoder training). Furthermore, the decoding of imagined objects reveals lower and lower visual representations. Our results demonstrate the homology between human and machine vision and its application in brain-based information retrieval.  In this project, LSTM is used to replace CNN, which is generally used in similar studies. With the goal of improving the extraction efficiency of brain region features, the optimization and exploration of traditional brain encoding and decoding methods within the scope of psychology are carried out.
